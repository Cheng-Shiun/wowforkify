# 🍴 Forkify — Modern Recipe Application

> This is a modern **Single Page Application (SPA)** developed as a practice project from the Udemy course: **The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a real-world recipe application while mastering advanced **ES6+ JavaScript** and the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.

- **Architecture**: Robust separation of concerns (Model, View, Controller) for maintainable code.
- **Modern Tooling**: Setting up a professional development workflow with NPM and Parcel.
