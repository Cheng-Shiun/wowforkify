# Forkify — Modern Recipe Application

> This is a modern **Single Page Application (SPA)** developed as a practice project from the Udemy course: **The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!**



## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a real-world recipe application while mastering advanced **ES6+ JavaScript** and the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.

- **Architecture**: Robust separation of concerns (Model, View, Controller) for maintainable code.
- **Modern Tooling**: Setting up a professional development workflow with NPM and Parcel.

| **Deployment** | Automated CI/CD via **Netlify**                           |
| **Build Tool** | **Parcel** (Module bundling, SASS, Transpiling)           |



## Features

- **Search Recipes**: Input some recipe name for search from the Forkify API.
- **Change Servings**: Use plus or minus button to change recipe serving; quantities update dynamically.
- **Bookmark Recipes**: Every recipe you love can be bookmarked (stored via **LocalStorage**).
- **Upload Your Own**: Use "Add recipe" on navigation and fill your recipe data to sync with the API.



## Tech Highlights

- **Async/Await**: Handling complex API data fetching and error states.
- **DOM Diffing Algorithm**: Optimized UI rendering by only updating changed elements.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**: Decoupling the View from the Controller logic.
